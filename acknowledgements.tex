I would like to thank Prof.~Jacek Gondzio for proposing such an
interesting and challenging project for me. This allowed me to focus
simultaneously on three of my  favourite subjects, Interior Point Methods,
Stochastic Programming and Software Development.
Moreover, his dedicated support has been crucial to my successful
completion of this project.

Dr.~Andreas Grothey's contribution to the success of this research
cannot be underestimated. Besides having spent the last few years
carrying forward the development of a fantastic software,
he has had the patience of introducing me to it and helping me out
in the frequent occasions of panic.

Big thanks to Cathy: she has offered to proofread this thesis, and she
has done a great job. 

Many friends deserve to be mentioned here as well, for the time spent together,
the conversations, and the help that I received in many forms from them.
So thanks to Aghlab, Gaurav, Iria, and to those that have left from Edinburgh
like Paulo, Eleni and Giorgos. 
David, Elingborg, Rosemary and Tomas have been great officemates and
friends too!

I got lots of support from my family, in particular in the last few months.
It's been really nice feeling cheered and spurred by them!

I am particularly indebted to Andrea, who has been close to me through
most of this time, and who would have surely proofread several drafts
of this document.
