I would like to thank Prof.~Jacek Gondzio for proposing such an interesting and challenging project for me. This allowed me to focus simultaneously on three of my  favourite subjects, Interior Point Methods, Stochastic Programming and Software Development. Moreover, his dedicated support has been crucial to my successful completion of this project.

Dr.~Andreas Grothey's contribution to the success of this research cannot be underestimated. Besides having spent the last few years carrying forward the development of a fantastic software, he had the patience of introducing me to it and helping me out in the frequent occasions of panic.

Many friends deserve to be mentioned here as well, for the time spent together, the conversations, and the help that I received in many forms from them. So thanks to Aghlab, Gaurav, Iria, and to those that have left from Edinburgh like Paulo, Eleni and Giorgos. Cathy, David, Elingborg, Rosemary and Tomas have been great officemates and friends too!

Among my friends in Italy, how can I not mention Gigi and Betti, Devit and Ciarli? And plenty of others too!

I got lots of support from my family, in particular in the last few months. It's been really nice feeling cheered and spurred by them!

I am particularly indebted to Andrea, who has been close to me through most of this time, and who would have surely proofread several drafts of this document.
