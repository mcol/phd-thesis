I would like to thank Prof.~Jacek Gondzio for proposing such an interesting and challenging project for me. This allowed me to focus simultaneously on three of my  favourite subjects, Graph Theory, Optimization and Software Development. Moreover, his dedicated support has been crucial to my successful completion of this project.

Dr.~Andreas Grothey's contribution to the success of this research cannot be underestimated. Besides having spent the last few years carrying forward the development of a fantastic software, he had the patience of introducing me to it and helping me out in the frequent occasions of panic.

I am particularly indebted to Andrea, who has proofread several drafts of this document. All remaining errors are most likely due to my last-minute changes.
