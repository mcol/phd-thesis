I would like to thank Prof.~Jacek Gondzio for proposing such an
interesting and challenging project. 
He shared his enthusiasm for interior point methods, and 
instilled in me a very keen interest in pursuing a research in this field.
Moreover, his dedicated support and the frequent discussions
have been crucial to my successful
completion of this research.

Dr.~Andreas Grothey's contribution to the success of this research
cannot be underestimated. 
He has had the patience of introducing me to \OOPS, and helped me out
in the frequent occasions of panic.

Big thanks to Cathy: she has offered to proofread this thesis, and she
has done a great job. 

Many friends deserve to be mentioned here as well, for the time spent together,
the conversations, and the help that I received in many forms from them.
So thanks to Aghlab, Gaurav, Iria, and to those that have left from Edinburgh
like Paulo, Eleni and Giorgos. 
I am particularly indebted to Andrea, who has been close to me through
most of this time, and has experienced the ups and downs of my PhD life.
It's been very nice to share room 6320 with Cathy, David, Elingborg, Rosemary
and Tomas. They have been great office mates and
friends too!

I got lots of support from my family, in particular in the last few months.
It's been really nice feeling cheered and spurred by them!
