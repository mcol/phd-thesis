I would like to thank Prof.~Jacek Gondzio for proposing such an
interesting and challenging project. 
He shared his enthusiasm for interior point methods, and 
instilled in me a very keen interest in working in this field.

Andreas Grothey's contribution to the success of this research
cannot be underestimated. 
He has had the patience of introducing me to \OOPS, and helped me out
in the frequent occasions of panic.

I am particularly indebted to Andrea, who has been close to me through
most of this time, and has experienced the ups and downs of my PhD life.
She is one of my best friends, and she taught me so much!

Many friends deserve to be mentioned here as well, for the time spent together,
the conversations, and the help that I received in many forms from them.
My thoughts go especially to Aghlab, Gaurav, Iria, Paulo, Eleni and Giorgos. 

It's been fun sharing room 6320 with Cathy, David, Elinborg, Rosemary
and Tomas. They have been great office mates and
friends.
Cathy has also proofread this thesis, and she has done a fantastic job. 
It was great to see her corrections marked in green, they had such a 
positive feeling!

I got lots of support from my family, in particular in the last few months.
It's been really helpful feeling cheered and spurred by them.
This work is dedicated to all of them. T'et cap\`i!
