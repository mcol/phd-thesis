\label{ch:Conclusions}

The relative youngness of interior point methods means that there is still
a lot to learn and try, particularly in practical implementations.

A big avenue of research, according to the author, is the development
of specialised techniques to exploit the problem structure.

This means that the development and diffusion of structure-exploiting
codes and of structure-aware modelling languages may become a necessary
requirement for a new generation of interior point codes.

In this sense, also theoretical developments in these aspects are 
wanted and necessary.
